This is a sample project that demonstrates how to create a full stack (Clojure + ClojureScript) project using the [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/) build tool. With `boot run`, you can instantly see your project at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and any edits to the ClojureScript will be automatically pushed to the browser. With `boot build`, you can make a standalone JAR file that includes your entire client and server code.

## Build Instructions

* Install the latest JDK
* Install [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/)
* Develop with `boot run`
* Build JAR file with `boot build`

## Contents

* `resources` The assets
* `src/clj` The server-side code
* `src/cljc` The client and server agnostic code
* `src/cljs` The client-side code
